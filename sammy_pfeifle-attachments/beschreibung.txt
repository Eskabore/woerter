This is a C program that reads words from a file, stores them in an array, and provides various options to manipulate and search them. The program reads words from a file named "woerter.txt", which should be located in the same directory as the executable.

The program starts by defining a constant ANZAHL_WOERTER (number of words), which is currently set to 3500 but can be changed by commenting/uncommenting different #define statements.

The program reads the words from the file using the woerterEinlesen function, which opens the file in read-only mode, reads the words one by one using fscanf, and stores them in the woerter array. The function returns the number of words read from the file.

The program then provides a menu with several options, including:

ausgeben: prints the first 10 words from the woerter array.
suchen: prompts the user to enter a word to search for and uses the lineareSuche function to search for the word in the woerter array. If the word is found, the function returns a pointer to the word; otherwise, it returns NULL.
umdrehen: reverses the order of the words in the woerter array.
bubblesort: sorts the words in the woerter array using the bubblesort algorithm.
gnomesort: sorts the words in the woerter array using the gnomesort algorithm.
insertionsort: sorts the words in the woerter array using the insertionsort algorithm.
selectionsort: sorts the words in the woerter array using the selectionsort algorithm.
bin. suchen: prompts the user to enter a word to search for and uses the binaereSuche function to search for the word in the woerter array. This function assumes that the array is sorted in ascending order.
quicksort: sorts the words in the woerter array using the quicksort algorithm.
Sortierung pruefen: checks if the words in the woerter array are sorted in ascending order.
worst case erzeugen: creates the worst-case scenario for the quicksort algorithm with the pivot element in the middle.
The program also defines several helper functions, including:

woerterAusgeben: prints the first n words from the woerter array.
lineareSuche: searches for a word in the woerter array using linear search and returns a pointer to the word if it is found; otherwise, it returns NULL.
woerterUmdrehen: reverses the order of the words in the woerter array.
bubblesort, gnomesort, insertionsort, selectionsort: sorts the words in the woerter array using the respective algorithms.
quicksort: sorts the words in the woerter array using the quicksort algorithm.
binaereSuche: searches for a word in the woerter array using binary search and returns a pointer to the word if it is found; otherwise, it returns NULL.
check: checks if the words in the woerter array are sorted in ascending order.
Overall, this program provides a basic implementation of several common algorithms for manipulating and searching arrays of strings. However, it has several limitations and potential issues, including:

The program assumes that the words are stored in a file named "woerter.txt" in the same directory as the executable.
The program does not perform any input validation, which can lead to buffer overflows and other security issues.
The program uses several C library functions that are considered unsafe and can lead to buffer overflows and other security issues, such as scanf,
